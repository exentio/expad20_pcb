# ExPad20
This is the PCB for the macro pad firmware I put on in the **exentio/expad20_firm** repo, since the handwire design has a lot of flaws, cause the case I made is pure shit and the plate I bought doesn't have enough space on the borders

**IT'S WORKING FINE, BUT IT'S A BIT OF A MESS SO BE CAREFUL**

Shoutout to DirtyPCBs.com, I ordered there the PCBs, great prices and helpful resources and tools
